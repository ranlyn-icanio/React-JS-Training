<h1>Beginner's Guide to Artificial Intelligence</h1>

<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence(AI)</strong> is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn. AI is impacting industries from <em>healthcare</em> to <em>finance</em></p>

<hr>
<h2>Types of AI</h2>

<h4>1.Narrow AI (weak AI)</h4>
<p>This type of AI is <strong>designed for specific tasks</strong> like facial recognition, language translation, or spam filtering. Most of today's AI systems are narrow.</p>

<h4>2.General AI (strong AI)</h4>
<p>This type of AI is <strong>designed to mimic human intelligence</strong> and is used in fields like healthcare, finance, and robotics. Some of today's AI systems are general.</p>

<h4>3. Super AI</h4>
<p>This AI would surpass human intelligence in every aspect — from creativity to emotional intelligence (some believe it's <strong>not possible</strong>). Think of it like &quot;Jarvis&quot; from Iron Man!</p>

<h2>Sample code</h2>
<p>Here's an example of how a simple AI model is trained in Python:</p>
<pre>
    <code>
        from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

        # Training data
        X = [[1], [2], [3], [4]]
        y = [2, 4, 6, 8]

        # Model
        model = LinearRegression()
        model.fit(X, y)

        # Prediction
        print(model.predict([[5]]))  # Output: [10.]
    </code>
</pre>
