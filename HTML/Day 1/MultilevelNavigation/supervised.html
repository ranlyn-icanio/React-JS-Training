  <h1>Supervised Learning</h1>

  <p>
    Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data. That means each training example is paired with an output label. The model learns to map inputs to outputs based on these examples.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Trains on input-output pairs</li>
    <li>Goal: Learn a mapping from inputs to outputs</li>
    <li>Requires a large amount of labeled data</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common Algorithms</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Linear Regression:</strong> For predicting continuous values</li>
    <li><strong>Logistic Regression:</strong> For binary classification problems</li>
    <li><strong>Decision Trees:</strong> Tree-based models that split data by features</li>
    <li><strong>Support Vector Machines (SVM):</strong> Finds the best boundary between classes</li>
    <li><strong>K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):</strong> Classifies based on closest data points</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Email spam detection</li>
    <li>Credit score classification</li>
    <li>Medical diagnosis (disease prediction)</li>
    <li>Customer churn prediction</li>
    <li>Sentiment analysis on reviews</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Advantages</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Clear and direct learning goal</li>
    <li>High accuracy when data is labeled well</li>
    <li>Wide range of established algorithms</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Limitations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Requires a large amount of labeled data</li>
    <li>Not suitable for tasks without labeled data</li>
    <li>May overfit if not regularized properly</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Learn More</h2>
  <p>Supervised learning is a foundational concept in machine learning and is often the first type of ML studied. Itâ€™s best for tasks like classification and regression where you already know the output you want.</p>
