  <h1>Reinforcement Learning</h1>

  <p>
    Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to maximize a reward signal.
    Itâ€™s inspired by behavioral psychology and trial-and-error learning.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Agent interacts with an environment</li>
    <li>Learns from feedback in the form of rewards or penalties</li>
    <li>Focuses on long-term cumulative reward</li>
    <li>Does not require labeled input/output data</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Common Algorithms</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Q-Learning:</strong> Value-based method that learns the expected reward for each action</li>
    <li><strong>SARSA:</strong> Similar to Q-learning but updates based on the actual action taken</li>
    <li><strong>Deep Q-Networks (DQN):</strong> Combines Q-learning with deep neural networks</li>
    <li><strong>Policy Gradient Methods:</strong> Directly learn the optimal policy instead of value functions</li>
    <li><strong>Actor-Critic:</strong> Combines value and policy-based approaches</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Game playing (e.g., AlphaGo, Dota 2 bots)</li>
    <li>Robotics (e.g., robot navigation, manipulation)</li>
    <li>Autonomous vehicles</li>
    <li>Stock market trading bots</li>
    <li>Recommendation engines</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Advantages</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Highly dynamic and adaptive</li>
    <li>Performs well in sequential decision problems</li>
    <li>No need for large labeled datasets</li>
    <li>Effective in learning complex behavior through experience</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Limitations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Requires a lot of training time and computational resources</li>
    <li>Reward design is critical and often non-trivial</li>
    <li>Can be unstable or slow to converge</li>
    <li>Exploration vs exploitation trade-off is hard to balance</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Reinforcement learning is at the heart of many cutting-edge AI systems. It is especially powerful for scenarios where decisions must be made sequentially and outcomes are delayed.
